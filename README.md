# About This Project
Cookbook is a freely accessible source of structured recipe data provided in the form of JSON files. Technical users can directly access the raw recipe data [here](https://github.com/CJStandingwater/cookbook/recipes). For non-technical users, user-friendly collections and curated recipe bundles are available [here](https://github.com/CJStandingwater/cookbook/releases).

Recipes in this repository are original submissions from families and individuals around the world. If you believe you are the original author of a recipe included here, please contact me directly, and I will promptly address your concerns. I sincerely hope you enjoy using this cookbook as much as I've enjoyed creating the framework for it.

# Goals
The primary goal of this project is to build an extensive, original, and freely accessible collection of recipes, structured specifically for easy integration and distribution through both commercial and open-source platforms. The data and releases in this repository are offered completely free of charge and may be used on your website, blog, book, or any other distribution channel. While I personally aim to maintain ad-free and cost-free distribution, how you choose to utilize these recipes and resources is entirely up to you.

As the project grows, I will establish dedicated channels for distribution to provide reliable, high-quality, and ad-free content sources to as wide an audience as possible.
