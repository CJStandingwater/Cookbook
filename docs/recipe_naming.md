To keep the cookbook organized, readable, and diverse, all recipe titles (and filenames) must follow the rules below:

# The name must be unique
No two recipes may share the same name or filename. If a similar recipe exists, contributors must clarify what makes their version different (e.g., ingredients, method, cultural variation).


# The name must contain between 3 and 5 words
- Minimum: 3 words (e.g., Chewy Oatmeal Cookies)
- Maximum: 5 words (e.g., Creamy Spicy Chickpea Lentil Soup)

# The name must include a core food item word
This is the central noun of the recipe, such as:

cookie, pasta, soup, smoothie, pizza, bread, salad, stew, cake, etc.

It should always appear at the end of the name.

# The name must include 1â€“4 descriptive modifiers

These help define what makes the recipe unique. They can describe:
- Texture/Technique (e.g., crispy, fluffy, roasted)
- Flavor/Key Ingredients (e.g., garlic, lemon, chocolate)
- Origin/Style (e.g., Korean, Southern, Moroccan)
- Contextual Tags (e.g., weeknight, holiday, lunchbox)

# The name must follow natural English word order

Use standard adjective-noun structure in this order:

- [Texture/Style] + [Ingredient/Origin] + [Food Item Word]

Correct Examples:
- Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies
- Spicy Korean Chicken Wings
- Toasted Pecan Banana Bread

Incorrect Examples:
- Cookies Chocolate Chip
- Bread Banana Pecan Toasted

As a rule of thumb, the name should sound correct when it completes the sentence "This is a recipe for. . .".
